Text Processing and Cleansing Pipeline

## Requirements

* Parse an input file (likely html, but later other formats to be included)
* Strip out (cleanse) content based on non-visible html tags
* Output an intermediate html file, using a stripped-down set of tags (informally STML)
* Run Spacey NLP pipeline against resulting content for initial tagging/analysis
